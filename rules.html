	<h1>The rules of AmongWORLD!.</h1>
	<h2>If you do not follow the rules listed below, expect a ban from our administrators!</h2>
	<br>
	<b>1. It is recommended to respect other users of our service.</b>
	<p>We highly encourage you to treat others the way you want to be treated regardless of their personalities, backgrounds or opinions to ensure that AmongWORLD! will always be a fun, friendly and suitable hangout community for people in all ages, sexes, races, ethnicities and religions. We welcome people from all countries!</p>
	<br>
	<b>2. Spamming is not allowed in our service.</b>
	<p>It is forbidden to continuously send similar messages and/or images in the chat. Doing so may result in a removal from the service. Sending copypastas, excessive self promotion and begging for being a administrator count. The owner only gives administrator permissions to extremely trusted users.</p>
	<br>
	<b>3. Do not evade bans.</b>
	<p>Ban evasion through other network, VPN, virtual browser, etc. results in an instant ban with no appeal. If you get banned for breaking any of the Rules, you may contact Windows XP#7441 or any of the administrators in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/4z7YcZYD96">our Discord server</a>.</p>
	<br>
	<b>4. Do not impersonate <rainbow-text>sysexternals</rainbow-text> or our administrators.</b>
	<p>Anyone who caught impersonating our admins will get banned. No excuses.</p>
	<br>
	<b>5. Attempting to log on AmongWORLD! with two tabs/devices aren't allowed, and is bannable.</b>
	<p>This rule is present to prevent impersonation of other users, server overload and DoS/DDoS attacks to our service.</p>
	<br>
	<b>6. We do not allow the usage of bots without permission from the administrators.</b>
	<p>Using bots without the consent of our admins is a bannable offense if constantly violated. This includes, but not limited to: Image (generator) bots, AI chatbots, spambots (as mentioned, this results in an immediate ban), et cetera.</p>
	<br>
	<b>7. Do not share malicious software.</b>
	<p>Source codes of malwares, links to viruses or malicious websites aren't allowed in AmongWORLD!. Telling other users to test your unoriginal piece of art in their virtual machines is also not allowed.</p>
    <br>
	<b>8. No NSFW/Gore/Scat/Rule 34/Hentai/Shock/Lewd content.</b>
	<p>Do not spread pornography/realistic gore (drawn gore may be accepted) in any means, including sending links/images with graphic content, abusing the "Custom Color" option to offend other users. Images containing inflation, fat "fetish" or transformation aren't bannable if pornography isn't involved.</p>
    <br>
	<b>9. Follow the law.</b>
	<p>Follow the law of the United States, Vietnam and other countries. Sending illegal stuff such as doxxing, distribution of lolicon/child pornography, animal abuse, gambling/drug selling websites, etc. results in an instant ban. The posting of Child Sexual Abuse Material will also result in a report to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (missingkids.org).</p>
	<br>
	<b>10. Do not abuse vulnerabilities/exploits in AmongWORLD!.</b>
	<p>If you find a bug/vulnerability, please report it to the original ThirdPanelSoft Inc. Discord server immediately or the owner of this site <rainbow-text>sysexternals</rainbow-text> (Windows XP#7441). Trying to abuse those exploits will result in an instant ban.</p>
